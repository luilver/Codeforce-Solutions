time limit per test1 second
memory limit per test256 megabytes

## Description

You are given three digits 𝑎
, 𝑏
, 𝑐
. Two of them are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

Find the value that occurs exactly once.


## Input

The first line contains a single integer 𝑡
 (1≤𝑡≤270
) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains three digits 𝑎
, 𝑏
, 𝑐
 (0≤𝑎
, 𝑏
, 𝑐≤9
). Two of the digits are equal, but the third one is different from the other two.

## Output

For each test case, output the value that occurs exactly once.
